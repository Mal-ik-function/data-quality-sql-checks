## Risk if not monitored

- Incorrect reporting
- Financial misstatements
- Regulatory non-compliance
- Poor decision-making

## Monitoring approach

Data quality checks should:

- Generate exception reports
- Escalate unresolved anomalies

## Ownership

Data quality controls must have defined:
- Control owner
- Monitoring frequency
- Escalation path
